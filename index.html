	  <h1>Food for your thoughts.</h1>
	  <p>Hearts are won through stomachs, so pack snacks and an open mind if you’ll be travelling this holiday season. Feed a stranger, hear their hopes, and learn from communities that aren't like yours.</p>

			<h2>America is disconnected.</h2>
			<p>More and more, people speak of a rift between two Americas. But we can’t engage with and heal a country we don't understand. For the coming holidays, many people will be travelling — let’s take advantage of this opportunity to talk with people outside our geographic bubbles.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>So here's the plan.</h2>

			<ol>
				<li>Take an hour out of your holiday.</li>
				<li>Grab some candy, muffins, or warm apple cider.</li>
				<li>Stand on Main Street, outside the supermarket, or wherever people are.</li>
				<li>Talk to a stranger, and offer something to eat in exchange for hearing what they’re hoping for in America right now.</li>
				<li>Listen and empathize.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Ready? Let's do it.</h2>

			<p>Commit to talk to strangers, and challenge your friends to do so too.</p>

			<h2>Advertise your presence.</h2>

			<p>Wear a t-shirt or display a sign to initiate and introduce yourself to passerby. We have a t-shirt that you can buy (we’re selling it at cost), and PDFs that you can print.</p>
			<p>How you choose to do this is up to you, but it should be legible at a distance, approachable, and explain our goal clearly.</p>

			<h2>Be prepared.</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>Conversations could veer into uncomfortable territory. Listen, don't try to argue or escalate. Our goal is to understand feelings, not change them.</li>
				<li>Protect yourself. Work in pairs, in a public place.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Share what you've heard.</h2>

			<p>Have a good conversation? Let the world know! <a href="http://ctt.ec/Mt8c3">Tweet</a> or post on Instagram with <strong>#foodforyourthoughts</strong>, but be sure not to violate the privacy of anyone you've met.
