	  <p>Traveling this holiday season? See how you can help burst our bubbles, connect with strangers, and learn from communities that aren't like ours.</p>
	</header>
	<main>
		<div class="section">
			<h2>America is disconnected.</h2>
			<p>More and more, it feels like we're living in bubbles. How can we engage with and heal a country we don't understand?</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>So here's the plan.</h2>

			<ol>
				<li>Grab some candy.</li>
				<li>Go to Main Street, or the grocery store, or wherever people are.</li>
				<li>Exchange a piece of candy for a hope.</li>
				<li>Listen and empathize.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Ready? Let's do it.</h2>

			<p>Commit to talk to strangers, and challenge your friends to do so too.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Have some materials.</h2>

			<p>Buy a t-shirt. Print a sign. Make a sandwichboard. How you do this is up to you.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Be prepared.</h2>

			<p>Conversations could veer into uncomfortable territory. Try to listen, don't try to argue or engage. Our goal is not to change minds, it is merely to try to understand them.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Share what you've heard.</h2>

			<p>Have a good conversation? Let the world know! <a href="#">Tweet</a> or Instagram with <em>#saysomethingeatsomething</em>. Be sure not to violate the privacy of anyone you've met.
